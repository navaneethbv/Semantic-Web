1. To run the program, import the folder Lab3_2 into the eclipse workspace and execute the file Lab_2.java into src. (I have included the jar files in the folders. If only the java file is copied, make sure to import the jar files to run jena and to create a MyDatabases folder)
2. The output files will be generated in the xml format.
